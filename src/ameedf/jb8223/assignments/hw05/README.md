## HW-05: HTML + JS + CSS
In this assignments you'll build the <i><b>Tic Tac Toe</b></i> game (again) using client side code only: HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
The game includes:
<ol>
	<li>Players data area (which player - X or O, and his score)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Which player (X or O)</li>
		<li>The score: must have a rounded border and a colored background</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The board</li>
	<ul>
		<li>9 empty cells at the beginning</li>
		<li>The last cell clicked will have a yellow background.</li>
		<li>When a player wins, the winning combination background will become green</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Notifications area that can contain on of the following messages</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Player X (or O): it's your turn (color: blue)</li>
		<li>This move is illegal (color: red)</li>
		<li>Player X (or O): it's your turn (color: green)</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<br/>
A sample UI is attached.
Feel free to change the fonts (family, size, colors), and the colors.

## Good luck :)
